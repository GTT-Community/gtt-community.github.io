"""CDAD - pending change-request notice (UserPromptSubmit hook).

cdad/CHANGE-REQUEST.md is edited by the Solution Designer directly, outside
any Claude Code tool call (the file is in permissions.deny, so the agent
cannot write it either). No PreToolUse/PostToolUse hook can see that edit -
it happens outside the tool loop entirely. This hook is the workaround: it
re-reads the file on every user turn and, if the request block has real
content the agent has not already flagged this session, adds one line of
context saying so.

It never analyzes the request, never drafts a proposal, and never invokes
cdad-propose-change - it only makes sure a filled-in request does not go
unnoticed until the Solution Designer happens to say "process the change
request." Acting on it remains a human-triggered decision, same as today.

Dedup state lives outside the repo (system temp), keyed by session id, so a
session is reminded once per distinct request content - never inside the
repo, never committed, never re-nagging every turn.

Exit 0 always. A broken hook must never block a prompt from being submitted.
