# CDAD - backlog structural integrity gate.
#
# backlog.md is not architecture (see AGENTS.md "Backlog governance") but it
# is still a governed artifact: Epic/Story identifiers must stay unique and
# traceable, and status values must stay inside the agreed vocabulary so
# both agents and humans can rely on them. This makes that check
# deterministic instead of a visual scan.
#
# What this does NOT enforce: whether an Epic/Story addition or removal went
# through cdad/CHANGE-REQUEST.md. That distinction (structural change vs.
# routine status update) requires judgment this script cannot make - it
# stays an instruction-plane rule in AGENTS.md, not a control-plane one here.
#
# Usage:
#   cdad/scripts/cdad-check-backlog.sh [path-to-backlog.md]
#
# Exit 0 = pass, 1 = violation, 2 = cannot determine.

cdad-check-backlog: FAILED

Structural integrity violations found above. An Epic ID must be unique, a
Story ID must be unique project-wide, and status values must stay inside
the agreed vocabulary so tooling and agents can rely on them without
re-parsing free text.
